# Relations

A \concept{Relation} names how Entities are connected. The most common relation is declared where
the connection actually lives: in the referencing field.

```ts
export const TodoList = entity({
  name: 'TodoList',
  fields: {
    id: f.id(),
    name: f.nonEmptyString({ trim: true }),
  },
});

export const TodoItem = entity({
  name: 'TodoItem',
  fields: {
    id: f.id(),
    list: f.ref(TodoList),
    title: f.nonEmptyString({ trim: true }),
    completed: f.boolean(),
  },
});
```

`TodoItem.list` is both a field whose value is a TodoList \concept{Ref} and the `belongsTo` relation
from TodoItem to TodoList. There is no separate `listId` field and no second declaration that restores
its lost meaning.

The physical representation belongs to storage. A relational adapter may conventionally store
`TodoItem.list` in `todo_items.list_id`; the Entity, its operations, and its clients continue to speak in
Refs.

## Use the reference without loading the relation

```ts
const research = TodoList.refById('list-research');

await TodoItem.insert({
  id: 'todo-map-runtime',
  list: research,
  title: 'Map the runtime',
  completed: false,
}).run();

const todos = await TodoItem.where(todo => todo.list.eq(research)).run();
```

The `list` value identifies one TodoList. Neither statement requires its current fields. Ontahí
lowers the Ref only when the chosen runtime reaches its storage boundary.

A Ref is also a valid membership criterion for its own Entity:

```ts
const lists = await TodoList.where(research).run();
```

## Materialize the relation when the result needs it

Without an include, each TodoItem contains a Ref at `list`. An include materializes the target at that
same path:

```ts
const todosWithLists = await TodoItem
  .all()
  .include(todo => ({
    list: todo.list.select(list => ({
      id: list.id,
      name: list.name,
    })),
  }))
  .run();
```

For a required `f.ref`, `list` becomes the selected TodoList value. A
`f.nullable(f.ref(TodoList))` produces `TodoList | null` after inclusion.

## Navigate through the relation

The Ref-valued field is already a typed membership criterion. An ordinary Query can select the
TodoItems belonging to one list:

```ts
const items = await TodoItem
  .all()
  .where(todo => todo.list.eq(TodoList.refById('list-research')))
  .orderBy(todo => todo.title)
  .run();
```

The generated browser projection authors the same Query:

> [!MARGIN] **One graph language, two execution models.** Notice how closely the server and client
> code correspond. On the server, `.run()` executes the Query directly. In React, `useGraphQuery`
> observes that same Query through React's reactive lifecycle. Ontahí's Entity and Query vocabulary
> remains ubiquitous across the boundary; only the execution model changes.

```tsx
export const ItemsForList = ({ listId }: { listId: string }) => {
  const todos = useGraphQuery(
    TodoItem
      .all()
      .where(todo => todo.list.eq(TodoList.refById(listId)))
      .as(TodoItemRow),
  );

  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.data?.map(todo => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

You do not need to invent a read-only Operation such as `fetchItemsForList` merely to wrap this
read; that would duplicate the Query as boilerplate. The Ref already authors the same semantic
membership, and the server's graph-read policy decides whether that field and operator are
remotely available.

Reify the behavior as an Operation only when the application needs a named server-owned contract:
authorization or other requirements, explicit failures, rate limiting or telemetry concerns,
secrets and Capabilities, coordination across effects, or a durable lifecycle. See
[Operations](07-operations.md), [Operation Contracts and Failures](08-operation-contracts-and-failures.md),
[Durable Operations](09-durable-operations.md), and
[Authentication and Principals](../03-runtimes/04-authentication-and-principals.md).

## Declare the inverse collection

A plural inverse is not stored as an Entity field. It points back through the field that owns the
references:

```ts
export const Enrollment = entity({
  name: 'Enrollment',
  fields: {
    student: f.ref(Student),
    course: f.ref(Course),
    status: f.string(),
  },
});

// In Student's declaration
relations: () => ({
  enrollments: relation.inverse(Enrollment.fields.student),
}),
```

`Enrollment.fields.student` already supplies the related Entity, the reference value, and the join
evidence. The inverse declaration adds only the domain name and `hasMany` cardinality.

## Change the connection as a Relation

Changing a connection is not an ordinary field update with the meaning removed. A
\concept{Relationship Command} preserves the structural intention:

```ts
const student = Student.refById('student-1');
const course = Course.refById('course-1');

const assign = student.course.assign(course);
const clear = student.course.clear();
```

The inverse direction authors the same canonical command:

```ts
course.students.add(student);
course.students.remove(student);
```

The verbs follow cardinality: use `assign` and `clear` for a to-one Relation, and `add` and `remove`
for a to-many Relation. They are not application-defined methods; Ontahí provides and validates
them from the Relation declaration. Relation names, available verbs, and participant Ref types are
all checked statically: `student.course.add(...)` and `course.students.assign(...)` do not type-check.

The methods are a local facade over a portable Ref. They are non-enumerable and do not become part
of its serialized identity; crossing a process boundary still carries only the Entity name and
locator. The lower-level `relationship(Entity, relationName, subject)` factory remains available to
framework integrations, but ordinary application code starts from the bound Ref.

Assigning through `Student.course` and adding through `Course.students` are two domain readings of
one link. Ontahí normalizes both directions to the identity of the Reference Field that owns the
connection. Clearing a required relation is rejected before mutation.

Execution returns a \concept{Relationship Delta}: only the links actually added or removed. An
idempotent assignment therefore returns empty arrays instead of claiming that a change occurred.
This exact delta can drive cache reconciliation, telemetry, reactions, or an audit trail without
reconstructing intent from an Entity snapshot.

```ts
type RelationshipDelta = {
  added: RelationshipFact[];
  removed: RelationshipFact[];
};
```

The command is structural behavior supplied by Ontahí. An application should not reimplement
referential checks, nullability, inverse normalization, or delta calculation in every Operation.
Use an Operation when assigning the relation also means approving enrollment, enforcing a domain
invariant, coordinating other mutations, requiring authority, or starting durable work.

## Declare a direct many-to-many Relation

A join table that only stores topology does not need to become a public Entity. Declare the
many-to-many Relation directly:

```ts
export const TodoItem = entity({
  name: 'TodoItem',
  fields: todoItemFields,
  relations: {
    tags: relation.manyToMany(Tag),
  },
});

mapRelation(TodoItem, 'tags', {
  type: 'many-to-many',
  from: 'todo_items.id',
  through: {
    table: 'todo_tags',
    fromColumn: 'todo_id',
    toColumn: 'tag_id',
  },
  to: 'tags.id',
});
```

Both endpoints may be Refs or Selections. Applying one command to N TodoItems and M Tags is the
ordinary Cartesian relation mutation, not a hand-written batch protocol:

```ts
const selectedTodos = TodoItem.selection(todo => todo.completed.eq(false));
const urgentTags = Tag.selection(tag => tag.name.eq('Urgent'));

const addUrgent = relationshipSet(TodoItem, 'tags', selectedTodos).add(urgentTags);
const removeUrgent = relationshipSet(TodoItem, 'tags', selectedTodos).remove(urgentTags);
```

The runtime resolves both Selections, validates explicit Refs exactly once, applies the edge
mutation atomically, and returns the exact delta. An empty filtered Selection is a valid no-op; a
missing explicit Ref is a cardinality failure and must not leave partial associations.

Selections are essential in this example because each endpoint describes a reusable set rather
than one identity. See [Selections](04-selections.md) for their membership and composition model.

## Promote an association when it has a life

An association remains an ordinary Entity when it has attributes, identity, behavior, or lifecycle
of its own:

```ts
export const Enrollment = entity({
  name: 'Enrollment',
  fields: {
    id: f.id(),
    student: f.ref(Student),
    course: f.ref(Course),
    startedAt: f.datetime(),
    status: f.string(),
    approvedBy: f.nullable(f.ref(User)),
  },
});
```

Ontahí does not require a public `AssociationEntity` subtype. Construction already requires the
participant Refs because they are required fields; deletion extinguishes that association. The
framework supplies ordinary Entity construction, deletion, referential interpretation, and applied
mutation outcomes. The application adds only the lifecycle and invariants that make Enrollment a
domain concept.

Creating and deleting the Entity are therefore another way to establish and extinguish a
relationship, while preserving that this association has identity and state:

```ts
const student = Student.refById('student-1');
const course = Course.refById('course-1');

await Enrollment.insert({
  id: 'enrollment-1',
  student,
  course,
  startedAt: new Date(),
  status: 'active',
  approvedBy: null,
}).run();

await Enrollment
  .selection(enrollment => enrollment.id.eq('enrollment-1'))
  .delete()
  .run();
```

Deletion uses a Selection because Entity Commands always state their target set explicitly; this
one selects exactly the association identity. The next chapter develops
[Selections](04-selections.md) as the reusable membership language behind that target.

Both a direct `Student.course` edge and an `Enrollment(student, course)` instance may expose the
same connection for traversal. Their mutation outcomes remain intentionally different. A direct
Relation reports links added or removed; creating or deleting `Enrollment` reports an Entity
lifecycle change, so its attributes, reactions, policy, and history are not erased.

This is the boundary:

- `TodoItem.tags` is topology, so it remains a direct many-to-many Relation;
- `Enrollment` has state and lifecycle, so it is an Entity;
- an Operation coordinates either form when structural mutation alone is not the whole intention.

## Break declaration cycles explicitly

When a reference field must target an Entity declared later, give Ontahí its semantic contract:

```ts
const StudentRef = entity.ref('Student', { fields: studentFields });

export const Enrollment = entity({
  name: 'Enrollment',
  fields: {
    student: f.ref(StudentRef),
    course: f.ref(Course),
    status: f.string(),
  },
});
```

`ontahi()` resolves deferred references against the complete Entity catalog before storage or
operations are bound. Prefer the direct Entity when declaration order already permits it.

## Keep explicit relations for exceptional mappings

The lower-level declarations remain available for legacy scalar fields, composite physical keys,
and mappings that cannot be derived from a reference field:

```ts
fields: {
  legacyListId: f.id(),
},
relations: {
  list: relation.belongsTo(TodoList, { via: 'legacyListId' }),
},
```

Use `f.ref` for the ordinary semantic case. Use explicit `belongsTo` and `hasMany` when the
exception itself is information the model needs to preserve.
